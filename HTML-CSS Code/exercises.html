    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <p>So today I went to the market and bought groceries.
        I also passed by the butchery and bought 1 kg of steak.
        I came back to the house and had a long conversation with my friend Miriam.
        I went back to the market in the evening to buy boiled maize.
        Upon returning to the house, I had a shower then took supper.
        I got excited about learning HTML and CSS at the prospects of developing my own website,
        and also commercialize the skill.
        Here I am, happy that I already started the journey towards being a web designer and developer</p>
